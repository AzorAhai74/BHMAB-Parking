Guest parking Page

* Problems:
    - The front circle of the entrance to the hotel is small and gets congested at check-in peak times.
    - Guests will abandon their vehicles after they check-in, go to their room, and clog up the front circle.
    - This creates a problem for flow from the front circle to the back parking lot behind the hotel.
    - Daily self-parking and valet written logs are inaccurate with missing information.
    - We have 75 parking spaces for 105 rooms. 
* Solutions:
    - Guests can select their parking option ahead of time and keep the front cirlce clear for valet parking.
    - Guests can enter back parking lot without entering front circle with gate code.
    - Guest will be able to enter their reservation and vehicle information online. 
    - On the back-end, a database will be able to keep a running flow of how many parking spaces are avilable at 
        any given time.  We will also be able to predict how many spaces will be avilable for future dates.
        - With this historical data being built, we will be able to predict trends and parking avilability and forecasting.
